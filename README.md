This was our first WordPress project so we had to learn how use php and WordPress as a CMS.

I used javascript, blur and auto focus for the search bar. 

I learned PHP file structuring for php, js, css files.

I also learned about file Hierarchy.

I also learned about the back-end UI for WordPress.

I also learned how important hooks and filters are for php.
